I essentially created four records instead of 3… Preparation.\\n\\nDNS records can change and evolve constantly. Say, for example, that you moved from AWS to Google Cloud (e.g., glb-blah.cloud.google.com); you’d need to update all three records:\\n\\n\\n  foo.mycompany.com –> glb-blah.cloud.google.com\\n  bar.mycompany.com –> glb-blah.cloud.google.com\\n  bas.mycompany.com –> glb-blah.cloud.google.com\\n\\n\\nHowever, if you used CNAME abstraction, you would only need to update the record for gw and point to the new GCP endpoint:\\n\\n\\n  gw.mycompany.com –> glb-blah.cloud.google.com\\n\\n\\nBut what if They don’t all point to the same endpoints now? Simple, just create another CNAME abstraction and update foo,bar,bas to point to the necessary endpoints.\\n\\n\\n  foo.mycompany.com –> glb-blah.cloud.google.com\\n  bar.mycompany.com –> glb-blah.cloud.google.com\\n  bas.mycompany.com –> glb-blah.cloud.google.com\\n\\n\\nShould I always abstract things? Not all the time. Here are the considerations I evaluate whenever I’m looking at this:\\n\\n\\n  Will > 1 thing ever point to this?\\n  Is the possibility that this will change non-zero?\\n\\n\\nIn most cases, things are never permanent, so in most cases I use URL abstractions to simplify my life down the line.\\n'}"

The project import is a 1-time bulk import of a Jira project into DevRev. Once ths import is complete, several options are made avaible for that project, such as resyncing changes, syncing back to Jira and bidirectional syncing.\\nTo import a Jira project, navigate to Settings > Imports then select Start Import or Import. From there, create a new connection to a Jira site or use an existing connection if you already have one. Once the connection is established, select the project you wish to import.

In order to sync a DevRev work item to Jira, it must be marked for syncing. Marking a DevRev work item for syncing can only be done during the creation of a work item. During work creation, select the dropdown for Type and set it to the Jira project and type the work item should be synced to. The display format is as follows: _{jira\\\\_project\\\\_name}/issues/{type}_. For example, if you want to sync to a Bug to a Jira project called Maple, this would show as Maple/issues/Bug.\\nMarking via API\\nTo mark an item for sync when creating via the API, the actual subtype name should be used. The subtype format is as follows: _jira\\\\_{jira\\\\_site}\\\\_{jira\\\\_project\\\\_name}\\\\_issues.{type}_. For example, if you want to sync to a Bug to a Jira project called Maple that's served via https://devrev.atlassian.net, this would show as _jira\\\\_devrev.atlassian.net\\\\_maple\\\\_issues.bug_.\\nAfter a DevRev work item has been marked for syncing, it's created in the specified Jira project next time the Sync from DevRev to Jira runs. This can be triggered manually or automatically via a periodic sync.

A periodic sync can be configured to Sync from Jira to DevRev, Sync from DevRev to Jira or both on a periodic basis. The default period is 1 hour.\\nTo enable periodic sync, go to Settings > Imports > Past Imports, find the previously imported project, and select the ⇆ > Start periodic sync option.\\n\\nIf you are enabling periodic sync on an imported Jira project for the first time, you should manually perform a Sync from Jira to DevRev first to configure how items from DevRev should be synced to Jira.\\n\\nTo disable periodic sync, go to Settings > Imports > Past Imports, find the previously imported project, and select the ⇆ > Stop periodic sync option.\\nDelete import\\nThis deletes any content created by the import, including users, works, and parts.\\nAn import and all the content it created can be deleted from DevRev. This can be useful when running POCs or to change the recipe used during the import. Once an import has been deleted, all the content it created gets deleted, even if they were modified in DevRev.

Otherwise, only previously imported issue changes are synced to and from the Jira project.\\n\\nProject import\\nTo ease the transition from Jira to DevRev, you can choose to import your Jira projects into DevRev. The project import is a 1-time bulk import of a Jira project into DevRev. Once ths import is complete, several options are made avaible for that project, such as resyncing changes, syncing back to Jira and bidirectional syncing.\\nTo import a Jira project, navigate to Settings > Imports then select Start Import or Import. From there, create a new connection to a Jira site or use an existing connection if you already have one. Once the connection is established, select the project you wish to import. At this point you are prompted to configure how to import the Jira project.\\nSetting up the import recipe\\nA Jira project import is highly configurable, and the configurations for a specific project import is refered to as the recipe. Here are some guidelines on what to expect:\\n\\nWhat type of work to create in DevRev?\\n\\nYou have the option to import Jira issues as DevRev issues (common - default) or DevRev tickets (uncommon).\\nChoose issues if you use the Jira project to track primarily development work.\\nChoose tickets if you use the Jira project to track only customer requests.\"], ['Jira import', 'What Jira types to import?\\n\\nTypically Jira projects contain multiple types: epics, stories, bugs and tasks are common.\\nYou can configure which types to import from Jira.'], ['Jira import', 'How to map Jira fields to DevRev fields?\\n\\nDevRev tries to automatically and sensibly map your Jira fields to corresponding fields in DevRev, but it may prompt you on how you want to map certain fields.'], ['Jira import', \"\\nHistorical imports\\nYou can view currently running and previous imports from any source, including Jira, by navigating to Settings > Imports > Past Imports.\\nSync from Jira to DevRev\\nAfter a successful import of a Jira project, you have the sync from Jira to DevRev option.\\nThis feature imports any new issues and any new changes to previously imported issues.\\nTo perform a one-time sync from Jira to DevRev, go to Settings > Imports > Past Imports, find the previously imported project and select the ⇆ > → From Jira to DevRev option.\\n\\nYou can track the progress by going to Settings > Imports > Ongoing Imports.\\n\\nThis overrides work's fields, even if they were changed in DevRev.\\nSync from DevRev to Jira\\nAfter a successful import of a Jira project, you have the sync from DevRev to Jira option.\\nThis feature writes back any changes made in DevRev to previously imported issues from Jira. Additionally, any new DevRev work marked for sync to this project is created in Jira.\\nTo perform a one-time sync to Jira, go to Settings > Imports > Past Imports, find the previously imported project and select the ⇆ > ← From DevRev to Jira option.\\n\\nYou can track the progress by going to Settings > Imports > Ongoing Imports.\\n\\nThis overrides issue's fields, even if they were changed in Jira.\\nMark a DevRev work item for syncing\\nMarking via UI\\nUsing the Sync from DevRev to Jira feature, it's possible to sync DevRev work items to Jira projects that have been imported to DevRev. In order to sync a DevRev work item to Jira, it must be marked for syncing. Marking a DevRev work item for syncing can only be done during the creation of a work item. During work creation, select the dropdown for Type and set it to the Jira project and type the work item should be synced to. The display format is as follows: _{jira\\\\_project\\\\_name}/issues/{type}_. For example, if you want to sync to a Bug to a Jira project called Maple, this would show as Maple/issues/Bug.\\nMarking via API\\nTo mark an item for sync when creating via the API, the actual subtype name should be used. The subtype format is as follows: _jira\\\\_{jira\\\\_site}\\\\_{jira\\\\_project\\\\_name}\\\\_issues.{type}_. For example, if you want to sync to a Bug to a Jira project called Maple that's served via https://devrev.atlassian.net, this would show as _jira\\\\_devrev.atlassian.net\\\\_maple\\\\_issues.bug_.\\nAfter a DevRev work item has been marked for syncing, it's created in the specified Jira project next time the Sync from DevRev to Jira runs. This can be triggered manually or automatically via a periodic sync. Future syncs keeps this item updated on both sides after it has been created in Jira.\\nPeriodic sync\\nAfter a successful import of a Jira project, you have the option to set up a periodic sync for the project. A periodic sync can be configured to Sync from Jira to DevRev, Sync from DevRev to Jira or both on a periodic basis. The default period is 1 hour.\\nTo enable periodic sync, go to Settings > Imports > Past Imports, find the previously imported project, and select the ⇆ > Start periodic sync option.\\n\\nIf you are enabling periodic sync on an imported Jira project for the first time, you should manually perform a Sync from Jira to DevRev first to configure how items from DevRev should be synced to Jira.\\n\\nTo disable periodic sync, go to Settings > Imports > Past Imports, find the previously imported project, and select the ⇆ > Stop periodic sync option.\\nDelete import\\nThis deletes any content created by the import, including users, works, and parts.\\nAn import and all the content it created can be deleted from DevRev. This can be useful when running POCs or to change the recipe used during the import. Once an import has been deleted, all the content it created gets deleted, even if they were modified in DevRev. It's possible to import the project again after its deletion.\\nTo delete and import and all the content it created , go to Settings > Imports > Past Imports, find the previously imported project, and select the ⇆ > Delete Import option.\"]]\n"
